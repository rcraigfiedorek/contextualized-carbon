- "This is equal to the emissions generated from \_\_\_\_ Hummer H3s driving at 60mph nonstop for an entire year."
  - The 2010 Hummer H3 4WD has a highway fuel economy of 18mpg (Fueleconomy.gov).
- "This amount of carbon alone will cause the melting of \_\_\_\_ of ice in the Arctic."
  - There is a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission. (Notz)
- "It would take \_\_\_\_ of tropical forest to absorb this amount of carbon per year from the atmosphere."
  - The annual sequestration rate of a moist tropical forest can be as high as 11 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per hectare per year (Mendelsohn, p. 95)
- "It would take \_\_\_\_ of New England forest to absorb this amount of carbon per year from the atmosphere."
  - The annual sequestration rate of a typical New England forest is 0.5 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per hectare per year (Mendelsohn, p. 95)
- "Releasing this amount of carbon dioxide into \_\_\_\_ of Earth's air column would cause lethal carbon dioxide poisoning for all humans in this area."
